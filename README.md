# Emily Writes Poems

## What's this project?
*I write poetry.*  
*I like creating with tech.*  
*Let's combine those two things*  
*with an app that explores my poems!*  
*Stats like line count and word frequency,*  
*and who knows?—Maybe some NLP too!*  

*—A very bad poem written by yours truly.*


## The technical stuff
* I'm exploring the MERN stack for this webapp!
* M: MongoDB [not yet set up]
* E: Express.js [to-do]
* R: React [Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)]
* N: Node.js [Also with Create React App]
