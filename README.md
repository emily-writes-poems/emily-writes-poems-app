## What's this project?
![Emily Writes Poems. A collection of my poems.](./images/ewpjan2021.png)
A webapp displaying the text and details of my poetry.


## The technical stuff
* The MERN stack:
    * M: MongoDB [set up and populated with poems!]
    * E: Express.js [backend routing]
    * R: React [Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)]
    * N: Node.js [Also with Create React App]
* I am using Python (with PyMongo) scripts for updating the database of poems.
* Hosted on Heroku, so there may a ~30 second delay in fetching the site initially.
