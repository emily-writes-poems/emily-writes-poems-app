![Emily Writes Poems. A collection of my poems.](./images/ewp.png)

## What's this project?
*I write poetry.*  
*I like creating with tech.*  
*Let's combine those two things*  
*with an app that explores my poems!*  
*Stats like line count and word frequency,*  
*and who knows?—Maybe some NLP too!*  

*—A very bad poem written by yours truly.*


## The technical stuff
* I'm exploring the MERN stack for this webapp!
    * M: MongoDB [set up and populated with poems!]
    * E: Express.js [backend routing]
    * R: React [Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)]
    * N: Node.js [Also with Create React App]
* I am using Python (with PyMongo) scripts for updating the database of poems.
* Playing around with using R for poem analysis and visualization, but will probably move these over to Python eventually.
